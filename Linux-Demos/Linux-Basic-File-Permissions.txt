If you want to change selective permission for Users, Group or Others use the + way

If you are okay with changing all permissions then use the Numeric way

Change Permission for all User, Group and Others 
chmod +x getUserInfo.sh 

Change Permission for all User and Group 
chmod ug+wx getUserInfo.sh 

Set permission for users with numeric:
Set Read Permission for all Users 
chmod 444 getUserInfo.sh 

Set RWX (7) for User, Read & Write (6) for Group & Just Read (4) for Others
chmod 764 Sample2.txt 

Set RW (6) for User, Read (4) for Group & nothing for Others (0)
chmod 640 1.txt

Add Singular Read permission to Group but don't change for others :
chmod g+r 1.txt
